      <p>This is completely not what I had story boarded but still follows an idea that I had.</p>
      <p> I wanted to work with connection. Peter Gabriel's music video for SledgeHammer is a direct inspiration by showing the connection of seemingly unrelated things.</p>
      <p> There are a lot of animals because animals are rad and both people and animals have very interesting connections to each other.</p>
      <p>The bridge between animal and human communication is so cool, as we learn our pet friend's body language and their specific personality quirks. </p>
      <p> For this I really wanted to play around with effects - I've used premiere before but never made anything abstract with it, so using all of the weird visuals was really fun. </p>
      <p>I tried to make them appear similar to video glitches, documentary scenes and in general just abstract. Not trippy or psychedelic.
